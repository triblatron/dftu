# dftu
A C++ units and physical quantities library.

Planned features:
* C++ 1998-2011 compatible
* thread-safe
* SI units
* dimensional analysis
* parsing of quantities
* output of quantities
* ASCII symbols by default; possible future support for unicode with an external library such as icu.

This library will provide run-time ( as opposed to compile-time like in boost unit ) dimensional analysis for values used in scientific and engineering applications.

It aims to be reasonably efficient and self-contained.

CMake will be used as the build system.
